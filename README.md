Bunch of different small systems I've wrote for the game of Rikudo No Ninshu in DM. http://www.byond.com/forum/Megamangeo/RNN


# Explanations

### Voiding

- A system written inspired by another BYOND game, basically, you roll a dice of luck, if you pass the value of Voiding. ex- 75, and you rolled 80. You forgoe death, and are still alive. 

### Kill

- A command that allows you to kill someone within the game, killing someone puts them through the Voiding proc.
  
### Pachinko

- Intended to be a money sink, Pachinko is a system I designed to be equal to Japanese Pachinko where you have a lot of metal balls running down the machine. It goes through the rolls in a for-loop, to see if you lose or win, and then inputs said values to the HTML.

### ChakraKunaiStealThing

- A system for the Game, to steal a bit of Chakra from people.

### ModifyDoorValue

- A command to adjust the value that is required to open the next thing. 

### <b>Trade Pack Mission </b> 
- A mission type that has the player carry out an Trade Pack towards to a X location.
- An criminal can steal said package, and bring it to a theives guild..

### <b> Awwlie Injury system </b>
- Injuries are objects, that when detected on the character during login phase, apply a debuff related to them.
- Injuries are healed when the character is logged, and the time to heal is smaller than the current time.
